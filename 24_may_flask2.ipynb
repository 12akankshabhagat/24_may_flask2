    "####  Web API:\n",
    "Definition: A Web API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of rules and protocols for building and interacting with\n",
    "software applications. It exposes endpoints for performing operations and exchanging data. \n",
    "\n",
    "Communication Protocol: Typically uses HTTP/HTTPS for communication. Some Web APIs may also use other protocols such as WebSockets\n",
    "for real-time communication.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Formats: Commonly uses JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) or XML for data exchange, with JSON being the more prevalent format\n",
    "due to its lightweight nature.\n",
    "\n",
    "Flexibility: Web APIs are generally more flexible and can support a wider range of actions and data formats. They are often designed\n",
    "to be RESTful (Representational State Transfer) but can also be implemented using other architectural styles like GraphQL or SOAP.\n",
    "\n",
    "Statelessness: Usually stateless, meaning each request from the client to the server is independent, and the server does not retain\n",
    "any client context between requests.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use Cases: Widely used for web and mobile applications, allowing them to interact with servers, access databases, or integrate with \n",
    "other services.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Web Service:\n",
    "Definition: A web service is a standardized way of integrating web-based applications using open standards like XML, SOAP, WSDL, and UDDI \n",
    "over an internet protocol backbone.\n",
    "\n",
    "Communication Protocol: Typically uses SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) over HTTP/HTTPS, but can also use other protocols like SMTP.\n",
    "SOAP is more rigid and protocol-heavy compared to REST.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Formats: Primarily uses XML for message formatting. The messages are typically defined by a WSDL (Web Services Description Language)\n",
    "document.\n",
    "\n",
    "Flexibility: Web services are more rigid and standardized, often focusing on enterprise-level integrations. They require strict adherence\n",
    "to protocols and message formats.\n",
    "\n",
    "Statelessness and Statefulness: Can be either stateless or stateful, depending on the design. SOAP web services, in particular,\n",
    "can maintain a state between requests if needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use Cases: Commonly used in enterprise environments for complex, distributed computing tasks and for integrating diverse applications\n",
    "and systems, often within the same organization.\n",
    "\n",
    "Web APIs are generally more modern, lightweight, and flexible, often used for web and mobile applications. Web services, on the other hand,\n",
    "are more traditional, rigid, and protocol-heavy, typically used for complex enterprise integrations.\n",
